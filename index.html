            <b>ISAMPP 2.0 released</b> - Dec 31, 2023
            </p>New version of ISAMPP library for San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) was released yesterday. <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 2.0</a> is probably the biggest update ever in more than 5 years since the release of first version back in August 2018. List of objects is finally complete and new functions were added. You can find more detailed list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/blob/main/docs/changelogs/isampp2_0.changelog" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>It's quite possible that ISAMPP 2.0 is also the final update, I am not sure yet. There are few remaining issues I wasn't able to solve before end of this year and thousands of sounds are undefined. So, there's still room for major improvements and/or new features but I would like to invest my time more wisely in the future. I have projects in mind I would actually like to work on instead of expanding library for multiplayer mod of 20-year-old game. We'll see.
            </p>Happy New Year's Eve!
            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot 20230420</b> - Apr 20, 2023
            </p>New version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">CSS LangDot</a> was released with changes added in past 6 months. Colors for FreeBasic and HCL were updated and 27 new dots were added for Circom, Cypher, Dotenv, Ecmarkup, Elvish Transcript, Godot Resource, Imba, Ink, JCL, Just, KerboScript, Mermaid, OASv2-json, OASv2-yaml, OASv3-json, OASv3-yaml, OpenAPI Specification v2, OpenAPI Specification v3, PDDL, PlantUML, Polar, Pyret, Scenic, Smithy, Snakemake, Sway and Visual Basic 6.0. I also fixed few mistakes in list.html file.
            </p>You can download this version from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot/releases/tag/20230420" target="_blank">repo</a>.

            <b>ISAMPP 1.9</b> - Dec 28, 2022
            </p>New stable version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.9</a> is here after almost a whole year of development as its biggest update ever. More than 7 thousand new lines of code are mostly related to lists of objects and sounds this game has. I was also able to finally fix object names added in previous versions of ISAMPP, plenty of pickup names were changed and documentation was expanded.
            </p>Even though I am very happy to get this release out before the end of this year, there's still a lot of work to be done for version 2.0 and I am not sure if I can finish everything next year. Therefore it is possible that I will split new features to different updates in 2.x branch and aim to mark ISAMPP as "done" with version 3.0. This might not mean much for you - the user, since I'm always trying to keep ISAMPP stable and ready-to-use in main branch anyway.
            </p>ISAMPP 1.9 can be downloaded from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/releases/tag/1.9" target="_blank">repository</a> and all changes are listed in <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/blob/main/docs/changelogs/isampp1_9.changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a>.

            <b>Logutil 2.0.0</b> - Nov 17, 2022
            </p>New version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> was finally released after 2 years. Logutil is just a tiny library for creating log files in C++ projects, however quite a lot was changed since last release. Old functions were (hopefully) improved, one function is new and big chunk of changes are related to new manual page and documentation in 'readme' file. Additional tests passed for the first time on Solaris operating system, however with one small <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil/issues/1" target="_blank">issue</a>. List of all changes in latest Logutil 2.0.0 can be found in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil/releases/tag/2.0.0" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>Oh, and by the way, I created an <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kkmzero" target="_blank">account</a> on Mastodon.
