            <b>ISAMPP 1.9</b> - Dec 28, 2022
            </p>New stable version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.9</a> is here after almost a whole year of development as its biggest update ever. More than 7 thousand new lines of code are mostly related to lists of objects and sounds this game has. I was also able to finally fix object names added in previous versions of ISAMPP, plenty of pickup names were changed and documentation was expanded.
            </p>Even though I am very happy to get this release out before the end of this year, there's still a lot of work to be done for version 2.0 and I am not sure if I can finish everything next year. Therefore it is possible that I will split new features to different updates in 2.x branch and aim to mark ISAMPP as "done" with version 3.0. This might not mean much for you - the user, since I'm always trying to keep ISAMPP stable and ready-to-use in main branch anyway.
            </p>ISAMPP 1.9 can be downloaded from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/releases/tag/1.9" target="_blank">repository</a> and all changes are listed in <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/blob/main/docs/changelogs/isampp1_9.changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a>.

            <b>Logutil 2.0.0</b> - Nov 17, 2022
            </p>New version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> was finally released after 2 years. Logutil is just a tiny library for creating log files in C++ projects, however quite a lot was changed since last release. Old functions were (hopefully) improved, one function is new and big chunk of changes are related to new manual page and documentation in 'readme' file. Additional tests passed for the first time on Solaris operating system, however with one small <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil/issues/1" target="_blank">issue</a>. List of all changes in latest Logutil 2.0.0 can be found in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil/releases/tag/2.0.0" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>Oh, and by the way, I created an <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kkmzero" target="_blank">account</a> on Mastodon.
