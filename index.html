            <b>GenPwdSh 1.3.0 released</b> - Apr 08, 2025
            </p>I released new version of GenPwdSh with very few small changes. GenPwdSh 1.3.0 adds support for generating passwords using BLAKE3 hash (if you have <i>b3sum</i> installed) and now it checks whether first argument used for specifying length is integer or not. Other than that, it's now possible to easily install GenPwdSh without manpage. Download links and brief changelog can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh/releases/tag/1.3.0" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>I'm also in process of archiving old repositories, some of which will be deleted in the future. I will write more about it before it happens, in case someone out there might care.

            <b>Autumn cleanup</b> - Dec 02, 2024
            </p>I've made decision to remove two of my repositories which serve no purpose whatsoever. One of them is <s>observe-lasco</s> - collection of data I used to learn something more about our Sun. Other repository is <s>asea-software-license</s> - draft of software license combining 3-Clause BSD License with one clause from zlib License. I planned to use this license for my projects but in the end I decided not to. Later I found other people who had exactly the same idea and they discussed it online, however I would not recommend using this license anyway. Both of these repositories will be deleted in the near future, perhaps followed by others. I've learned enough in last 4-7 years to see that big portion of my old projects are bad and should never be used.

            <b>Few words about fonts and syntax highlighting</b> - Sep 29, 2024
            </p>I got sick recently so I decided to waste some time, install Debian and go through few of my hobby projects I abandoned years ago. I installed my own dotfiles for Nano and I realized that this colorful syntax highlighting just doesn't work for me anymore, it only distracts me. I spent one evening creating very minimalistic syntax highlighting package which just displays few keywords in bold and comments/strings in italics. That's it. Then I installed font which I can actually read and because I have it bold by default I saw that my new highlighting won't work with it. Time was successfully wasted but this experience helped me to understand few things.
            </p>I never thought about fonts that much before and it took me many years to realize that all I really need is a readable font. I tried many color themes in various editors and I tried to use different fonts, including Intel One Mono which is supposed to work well even for people who don't have good eyesight. For some reason all modern fonts look blurry to me, at least compared to -for example- Courier/Courier New or whatever were default fonts in Visual C++ 6 and 2003. Now I know that I should have no problem reading text even on white background. Good font won't make my eyes tired. Syntax highlighting and dark themes will not improve readability if the font is terrible.
            </p>In conclusion - I wasted a lot of time with UI themes, fonts and syntax highlighting. However, I understand that most people refuse to read code if it's not colorful enough and that's okay. You should use whatever works for you, we all have different preferences. Anyway, I uploaded this minimal syntax highlighting package to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/nano-syntax-highlighting" target="_blank">nano-syntax-highlighting</a> repo. I also added syntax highlighting for Markdown and Bash. It's nothing exceptional but maybe someone out there will find it useful. It's definitely better than whatever most Linux distros have pre-installed.

            <b>CSS LangDot 20240528</b> - May 28, 2024
            </p>New snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">CSS LangDot</a> (GitHub programming language color dots in CSS) was released. This snapshot adds color dots for roughly 30 more languages. Colors for OCaml and Sway were updated as well. You can find more detailed changelog and download links in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot/releases/tag/20240528" target="_blank">repo</a>.
            </p>Sadly, making commits to public projects is getting very difficult for me, no matter how silly and useless those projects are. I spend unreasonable amount of time just anxiously verifying trivial changes over and over again. I don't know what's wrong with me. I had problems with anxiety for many years but never like this. I'm sorry things take me long time.
