            <b>Autumn cleanup</b> - Dec 02, 2024
            </p>I've made decision to remove two of my repositories which serve no purpose whatsoever. One of them is <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a> - collection of data I used to learn something more about our Sun. Other repository is <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/asea-software-license" target="_blank">asea-software-license</a> - draft of software license combining 3-Clause BSD License with one clause from zlib License. I planned to use this license for my projects but in the end I decided not to. Later I found other people who had exactly the same idea and they discussed it online, however I would not recommend using this license anyway. Both of these repositories will be deleted in the near future, perhaps followed by others. I've learned enough in last 4-7 years to see that big portion of my old projects are bad and should never be used.

            <b>Few words about fonts and syntax highlighting</b> - Sep 29, 2024
            </p>I got sick recently so I decided to waste some time, install Debian and go through few of my hobby projects I abandoned years ago. I installed my own dotfiles for Nano and I realized that this colorful syntax highlighting just doesn't work for me anymore, it only distracts me. I spent one evening creating very minimalistic syntax highlighting package which just displays few keywords in bold and comments/strings in italics. That's it. Then I installed font which I can actually read and because I have it bold by default I saw that my new highlighting won't work with it. Time was successfully wasted but this experience helped me to understand few things.
            </p>I never thought about fonts that much before and it took me many years to realize that all I really need is a readable font. I tried many color themes in various editors and I tried to use different fonts, including Intel One Mono which is supposed to work well even for people who don't have good eyesight. For some reason all modern fonts look blurry to me, at least compared to -for example- Courier/Courier New or whatever were default fonts in Visual C++ 6 and 2003. Now I know that I should have no problem reading text even on white background. Good font won't make my eyes tired. Syntax highlighting and dark themes will not improve readability if the font is terrible.
            </p>In conclusion - I wasted a lot of time with UI themes, fonts and syntax highlighting. However, I understand that most people refuse to read code if it's not colorful enough and that's okay. You should use whatever works for you, we all have different preferences. Anyway, I uploaded this minimal syntax highlighting package to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/nano-syntax-highlighting" target="_blank">nano-syntax-highlighting</a> repo. I also added syntax highlighting for Markdown and Bash. It's nothing exceptional but maybe someone out there will find it useful. It's definitely better than whatever most Linux distros have pre-installed.

            <b>CSS LangDot 20240528</b> - May 28, 2024
            </p>New snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">CSS LangDot</a> (GitHub programming language color dots in CSS) was released. This snapshot adds color dots for roughly 30 more languages. Colors for OCaml and Sway were updated as well. You can find more detailed changelog and download links in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot/releases/tag/20240528" target="_blank">repo</a>.
            </p>Sadly, making commits to public projects is getting very difficult for me, no matter how silly and useless those projects are. I spend unreasonable amount of time just anxiously verifying trivial changes over and over again. I don't know what's wrong with me. I had problems with anxiety for many years but never like this. I'm sorry things take me long time.

            <b>ISAMPP 2.0 released</b> - Dec 31, 2023
            </p>New version of ISAMPP library for San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) was released yesterday. <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 2.0</a> is probably the biggest update in more than 5 years since the release of first version back in August 2018. List of objects is finally complete and new functions were added. You can find more detailed list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/blob/main/docs/changelogs/isampp2_0.changelog" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>It's quite possible that ISAMPP 2.0 is also the final update, I am not sure yet. There are few remaining issues I wasn't able to solve before end of this year and thousands of sounds are undefined. So, there's still room for major improvements and/or new features but I would like to invest my time more wisely in the future. I have projects in mind I would actually like to work on instead of expanding library for multiplayer mod of 20-year-old game. We'll see.
            </p>Happy New Year's Eve!
            </p></p></br>
