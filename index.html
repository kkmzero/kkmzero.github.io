            <b>Cleanup, Pt. 2</b> - June 05, 2025
            </p>As I mentioned in one of my previous posts, I decided to delete following repositories because they are unfinished, unmaintained for very long time, not useful or just simply very low quality pojects: <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logger" target="_blank">logger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/rgba-to-float-color-converter" target="_blank">rgba-to-float-color-converter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/sfta-sa-mp-gamemode" target="_blank">sfta-sa-mp-gamemode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/unicode-ascii-spinners" target="_blank">unicode-ascii-spinners</a>. As far as I'm concerned, nothing of value will be lost. These four repositories will be deleted in the near future.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot 20250507</b> - May 07, 2025
            </p>After almost a year of regular updates I released new snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">CSS LangDot</a> which adds support for roughly 45 more programming languages and various file formats such as M3U. You can find more information and download links in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot/releases/tag/20250507" target="_blank">repository</a>. CSS LangDot snapshots are mainly for people who want to keep the CSS file on their servers without need for frequent updates but direct import via raw.githack.com still works.

            <b>GenPwdSh 1.3.0 released</b> - Apr 08, 2025
            </p>I released new version of GenPwdSh with very few small changes. GenPwdSh 1.3.0 adds support for generating passwords using BLAKE3 hash (if you have <i>b3sum</i> installed) and now it checks whether first argument used for specifying length is integer or not. Other than that, it's now possible to easily install GenPwdSh without manpage. Download links and brief changelog can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh/releases/tag/1.3.0" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>I'm also in process of archiving old repositories, some of which will be deleted in the future. I will write more about it before it happens, in case someone out there might care.

            <b>Autumn cleanup</b> - Dec 02, 2024
            </p>I've made decision to remove two of my repositories which serve no purpose whatsoever. One of them is <s>observe-lasco</s> - collection of data I used to learn something more about our Sun. Other repository is <s>asea-software-license</s> - draft of software license combining 3-Clause BSD License with one clause from zlib License. I planned to use this license for my projects but in the end I decided not to. Later I found other people who had exactly the same idea and they discussed it online, however I would not recommend using this license anyway. Both of these repositories will be deleted in the near future, perhaps followed by others. I've learned enough in last 4-7 years to see that big portion of my old projects are bad and should never be used.
