            <b>Summer summary</b> - Oct 04, 2025
            </p>A lot has happened during summer. As always, I do most of my work offline, some projects are not ready yet and I possibly can not talk about other projects here. I've read GitHub's TOS and it's still not clear to me whether I am allowed to talk about software I created (even though it's proprietary) or not. In best case scenario it's a <i>grey area</i>. I'm planning to host website somewhere else where I can be totally free without any question marks.
            </p>Recently I published this project: <a href="https://codeberg.org/kkmzero/x11-opengl-window" target="_blank">x11-opengl-window</a>. I know there are many people out there like me, who know how to do anything on Windows but task as simple as opening window on Linux seems unachievable. Therefore I hope this will be helpful. However, I'm very sad that Linux won't allow me to statically link my software, unlike FreeBSD - proper production ready operating system which allows me to do anything I want. Anyway, this is also the first repo I created on Codeberg. I'm still testing the waters, there are aspects of Codeberg I think are unfortunate but as everyone else I am forced to look for alternatives because Microsoft is pushing me over the edge every single day.
            </p>Lastly, I moved back to Twitter (or X or whatever). Mastodon is genuinely better service but I'm fed up with it. Posts that I've read there were becoming more and more insane, often times very gross, even pornographic. I mean that type of stuff you would never say publicly, definitely not in part of the world where I live. I don't like Musk but at least on Twitter my feed is filled with stuff I might care about. Normal posts, people sharing what they created, what they achieved, what they discovered or learned. And I don't have to be afraid to interact with other people if I choose to do so, unlike on Mastodon where you are forced to tolerate insanity or cease to exist. Social media are dumb and toxic but everything has its limits.

            <b>Cleanup, Pt. 2</b> - June 05, 2025
            </p>As I mentioned in one of my previous posts, I decided to delete following repositories because they are unfinished, unmaintained for very long time, not useful or just simply very low quality pojects: <s>logger</s>, <s>rgba-to-float-color-converter</s>, <s>sfta-sa-mp-gamemode</s> and <s>unicode-ascii-spinners</s>. As far as I'm concerned, nothing of value will be lost. These four repositories will be deleted in the near future.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot 20250507</b> - May 07, 2025
            </p>After almost a year of regular updates I released new snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">CSS LangDot</a> which adds support for roughly 45 more programming languages and various file formats such as M3U. You can find more information and download links in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot/releases/tag/20250507" target="_blank">repository</a>. CSS LangDot snapshots are mainly for people who want to keep the CSS file on their servers without need for frequent updates but direct import via raw.githack.com still works.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>GenPwdSh 1.3.0 released</b> - Apr 08, 2025
            </p>I released new version of GenPwdSh with very few small changes. GenPwdSh 1.3.0 adds support for generating passwords using BLAKE3 hash (if you have <i>b3sum</i> installed) and now it checks whether first argument used for specifying length is integer or not. Other than that, it's now possible to easily install GenPwdSh without manpage. Download links and brief changelog can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh/releases/tag/1.3.0" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>I'm also in process of archiving old repositories, some of which will be deleted in the future. I will write more about it before it happens, in case someone out there might care.
            </p></p></br>
