            <b>CSS LangDot 20220329</b> - Mar 30, 2022
            </p>In latest update to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> were added new dots for Berry, Cadence, Genero, Genero Forms and Monkey C. Color values for Vala were updated also. New version <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot/releases/tag/20220329" target="_blank">20220329</a> was published with all changes introduced during last 6 months in case someone is not using direct import link from main branch.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>GenPwdSh 1.2.0</b> - Mar 22, 2022
            </p>Update to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> 1.2.0 was published with few changes which make this script at least semi-useful, however still not perfect by any means. Downloads with more detailed changelog can be found in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh/releases/tag/1.2.0" target="_blank">repo</a>.
            </p></p></br>	

            <b>Depressing summary of February</b> - Feb 27, 2022
            </p>In latest <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> update I added color dots for 2-Dimensional Array, Debian Package Control File, DenizenScript, Euphoria, kvlang and MiniYAML.
            </p>In meantime, work on new version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP</a> continues slowly but open.mp project decided to destroy their own clone of SA-MP documentation/wiki and they do not seem to even care - as always. This means that I will have to provide online documentation myself and destroy my sight completely while doing so, just because bunch of amateurs always have to break what used to work just fine - and leave it broken.
            </p><a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> is still a piece of garbage script because I cbf to give it simple rework (G-D's will, it will be done one day, I hope). Update of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> is still pending and other projects are on hold while assholes with power decided that we need another war in which more innocent blood can be spilled for nothing. Oh, by the way, <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a> is still receiving semi-regular updates...
            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot Update</b> - Feb 19, 2022
            </p>New update to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> added support for Clarity, Curry, Gleam, GSC, hoon, Janet, Mint, Procfile, RPGLE, Vyper and Witcher Script. As a side note, there are few changes pending for next <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> release with code rework after almost 2 years. 
            </p></p></br>

            <b>Beginning of a new year</b> - Jan 18, 2022
            </p>There were some minor news since last message back in October. <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.8</a> was released, yet another update to GNU Nano dotfiles is expected to come and archive <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a> for last year is done. Last update for <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> introduced support for few new languages.
            </p></p></br>

            <h1>Y2021</h1>

            <b>ISAMPP 1.7 is out</b> - Oct 27, 2021
            </p>New version of library <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.7</a> is out for people who still care about San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) and maintain its game modes. This release was quite huge and in many aspects even chaotic but following version should be much more clearer in terms of what was really added or changed. ISAMPP 1.8 is already in development and -hopefully- everything important will be done next year with ISAMPP 2.0. There are still some remaining features waiting for implementation and probably largest chunk of LOC will be taken by objects list.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>GenPwdSh 1.1.0 released</b> - Oct 23, 2021
            </p>Tiny update for <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> script was released with change to input value for some used algorithms. Also, MD5 was removed from the list of available algorithms.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>Summary of development in September 2021</b> - Sep 30, 2021
            </p>This was probably my most active month when it comes to number of commits to public repositories ever. Initial releases of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> are done with more to come, hopefully soon. Plus <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP</a> got two separate updates, while its next version is already in development and bringing this project closer to being done. I got this site going and for you who are interested in our Sun, there's more at <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a>.
