            <h1>Y2022</h1>

            <b>ISAMPP 1.9</b> - Dec 28, 2022
            </p>New stable version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.9</a> is here after almost a whole year of development as its biggest update ever. More than 7 thousand new lines of code are mostly related to lists of objects and sounds this game has. I was also able to finally fix object names added in previous versions of ISAMPP, plenty of pickup names were changed and documentation was expanded.
            </p>Even though I am very happy to get this release out before the end of this year, there's still a lot of work to be done for version 2.0 and I am not sure if I can finish everything next year. Therefore it is possible that I will split new features to different updates in 2.x branch and aim to mark ISAMPP as "done" with version 3.0. This might not mean much for you - the user, since I'm always trying to keep ISAMPP stable and ready-to-use in main branch anyway.
            </p>ISAMPP 1.9 can be downloaded from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/releases/tag/1.9" target="_blank">repository</a> and all changes are listed in <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp/blob/main/docs/changelogs/isampp1_9.changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a>.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>Logutil 2.0.0</b> - Nov 17, 2022
            </p>New version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> was finally released after 2 years. Logutil is just a tiny library for creating log files in C++ projects, however quite a lot was changed since last release. Old functions were (hopefully) improved, one function is new and big chunk of changes are related to new manual page and documentation in 'readme' file. Additional tests passed for the first time on Solaris operating system, however with one small <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil/issues/1" target="_blank">issue</a>. List of all changes in latest Logutil 2.0.0 can be found in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil/releases/tag/2.0.0" target="_blank">repository</a>.
            </p>Oh, and by the way, I created an <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kkmzero" target="_blank">account</a> on Mastodon.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot 20221019</b> - Oct 19, 2022

            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot Update</b> - Jun 09, 2022

            </p>In latest update to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> were added new dots for Berry, Cadence, Genero, Genero Forms and Monkey C.

            </p></p></br>

            <b>GenPwdSh 1.2.0</b> - Mar 22, 2022
            </p>Update to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> 1.2.0 was published with few changes which make this script at least semi-useful, however still not perfect by any means. Downloads with more detailed changelog can be found in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh/releases/tag/1.2.0" target="_blank">repo</a>.
            </p></p></br>	

            <b>Depressing summary of February</b> - Feb 27, 2022
            </p>In latest <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> update I added color dots for 2-Dimensional Array, Debian Package Control File, DenizenScript, Euphoria, kvlang and MiniYAML.
            </p>In meantime, work on new version of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP</a> continues slowly but open.mp project decided to destroy their own clone of SA-MP documentation/wiki and they do not seem to even care - as always. This means that I will have to provide online documentation myself and destroy my sight completely while doing so.
            </p><a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> is still a piece of garbage script because I cbf to give it simple rework (G-D's will, it will be done one day, I hope). Update of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> is pending and <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a> is still receiving semi-regular updates...
            </p></p></br>

            <b>CSS LangDot Update</b> - Feb 19, 2022
            </p>New update to <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> added support for Clarity, Curry, Gleam, GSC, hoon, Janet, Mint, Procfile, RPGLE, Vyper and Witcher Script. As a side note, there are few changes pending for next <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/logutil" target="_blank">logutil</a> release with code rework after almost 2 years. 
            </p></p></br>

            <b>Beginning of a new year</b> - Jan 18, 2022
            </p>There were some minor news since last message back in October. <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.8</a> was released, yet another update to GNU Nano dotfiles is expected to come and archive <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a> for last year is done. Last update for <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> introduced support for few new languages.
            </p></p></br>

            <h1>Y2021</h1>

            <b>ISAMPP 1.7 is out</b> - Oct 27, 2021
            </p>New version of library <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP 1.7</a> is out for people who still care about San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) and maintain its game modes. This release was quite huge and in many aspects even chaotic but following version should be much more clearer in terms of what was really added or changed. ISAMPP 1.8 is already in development and -hopefully- everything important will be done next year with ISAMPP 2.0. There are still some remaining features waiting for implementation and probably largest chunk of LOC will be taken by objects list.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>GenPwdSh 1.1.0 released</b> - Oct 23, 2021
            </p>Tiny update for <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> script was released with change to input value for some used algorithms. Also, MD5 was removed from the list of available algorithms.
            </p></p></br>

            <b>Summary of development in September 2021</b> - Sep 30, 2021
            </p>This was probably my most active month when it comes to number of commits to public repositories ever. Initial releases of <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/css-langdot" target="_blank">css-langdot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/genpwdsh" target="_blank">GenPwdSh</a> are done with more to come, hopefully soon. Plus <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/isampp" target="_blank">ISAMPP</a> got two separate updates, while its next version is already in development and bringing this project closer to being done. I got this site going and for you who are interested in our Sun, there's more at <a href="https://github.com/kkmzero/observe-lasco" target="_blank">observe-lasco</a>.
